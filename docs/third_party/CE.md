Welcome to the **Conlang Engine**, a powerful, modern React-based workspace designed to help conlangers build, document, and practice their constructed languages. 

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Zustand**, this version is the next evolution of the original engine—optimized for performance, security, and scalability. Your data lives entirely in your browser's local storage for 100% privacy, with secure cloud sync for power users.

## ✨ Features Highlight

### 🧠 Grammar & Linguistics
* **Universal Matrix Engine:** Define your phonetic inventory, syllable structures, and regex-based inflection rules. The engine automatically generates dynamic conjugation and declension tables.
* **Ambiguity-Aware Syntax Analyzer:** Type a sentence in your conlang. The engine parses roots, identifies affixes, and validates your sentence against your chosen word order.
* **Numeral System Suite:** Fully customizable number bases (Binary, Octal, Duodecimal, Vigesimal, etc.) with a built-in base converter and native calculator.
* **Historical Sound Changer (SCA):** Evolve your dictionary natively using Regex environmental rules.
* **Phonotactics Lab:** Visual charts and statistics of your most used phonemes and syllable distributions.

### 📖 Documentation & Lore
* **Public Reader Showcase:** Generate a secure, standalone URL to showcase your conlang to the world in a beautiful, read-only "Museum View."
* **Interactive Reader (IGT):** Paste large texts and hover over words to see instant glosses and morphological breakdowns using the Leipzig Glossing Rules.
* **Grammar Wiki:** A built-in rich text editor to document your phonology, morphology, syntax, and lore.
* **Help Center Walkthrough:** Integrated 5-phase "Build Roadmap" to guide you from phonology to full documentation.

### 🎨 Typography & Practice
* **Interactive Flashcards (Conlingo):** Practice your vocabulary with a built-in 3D spaced-repetition deck. Tracks your daily study streak!
* **Font Studio & Custom Fonts:** Draw your own logographic ideograms directly in the browser, or upload your own `.ttf`/`.otf` files to render your unique glyphs natively.
* **Typology Support:** Switch seamlessly between Alphabetic, Syllabic (Grid-based), and Logographic writing systems.

## ☁️ Local vs. LIVE Tier

* **Auto Cloud Sync:** Backed by Supabase, your dictionary is securely saved to the cloud with full RLS protection.
* **Multi-Project Management:** A dashboard to build and manage several languages at once.
* **Public Showcase Links:** Host your language on a dedicated `/view/` route for community feedback.
* **Automatic Activation:** Secure integration with Patreon and Ko-fi for instant pro-status upgrades.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React 18+ with Vite.
* **State Management:** Zustand with persistent middleware.
* **Styling:** Modern Vanilla CSS3 with HSL-based design system and glassmorphism effects.
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Row Level Security, Edge Functions).
